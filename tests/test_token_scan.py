"""Fixtures for the identity-token matcher.

Two directions, both pinned:

  * An English word that merely CONTAINS a token must pass. This is the
    regression the old matcher failed: a word like `suite` was reported as a short
    chain token, and `nearest` was reported as another, because the boundary test
    treated the following letter as a separator.
  * Every declared token must fail when it stands alone in a sentence. The tokens
    are read from the vocabulary rather than retyped, so adding a token to the
    list immediately adds a fixture for it -- and this file cannot drift from the
    list it tests.
